# SolidityEducation
This is a self made solidity repository based on many solidity tutorials and tasks I have complete. I intend to use this repository both as a proof of my knowledge but mostly as a cheat sheet repository from which I can easily access basic scripts and remind my self of  the central functionalities of solidity and there syntax.
